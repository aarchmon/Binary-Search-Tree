# Binary Search Trees

The purpose of this repository is to study the Binary Search Tree data structure as well as practice implementing the _GraphViz_ library with a fully functional program. This _GraphViz_ library is not the one found in the _Boost_ library.

1. Clone repository into a desired location on your computer.

2. Once inside the repository, navigate to the ```Debug``` folder.

3. Run ```make clean``` to reset the build.

4. Run the following command to build the project.

```g++ -O0 -g3 -Wall -c -fmessage-length=0 -MMD -MP -MF"source/Runner.d" -MT"source/Runner.o" -o "source/Runner.o" "../source/Runner.cpp"```

5. An executable is now created. Run ```./Binary\ Search\ Tree``` to execute the program.
